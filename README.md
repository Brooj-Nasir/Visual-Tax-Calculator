## What It Does

The `MyForm` class defines a Windows Forms application that performs the following tasks:

1. **User Input**:
   - The form has three input fields (`textBox1`, `textBox2`, `textBox3`) where users can enter different salary amounts.

2. **Calculate Total Salary**:
   - When the "CalculateTax" button is clicked, the application sums the values from the three salary text boxes to compute the total salary.
   - The result is displayed in `textBox4`.

3. **Compute Tax**:
   - The application calculates tax based on predefined salary brackets:
     - **1%** tax for salaries between 40,000 and 70,000
     - **15%** tax for salaries between 70,000 and 100,000
     - **20%** tax for salaries between 100,000 and 130,000
     - **25%** tax for salaries between 130,000 and 160,000
     - **30%** tax for salaries between 160,000 and 200,000
     - **40%** tax for salaries above 200,000
   - The computed tax is displayed in `textBox5`.

4. **Calculate Net Salary**:
   - The net salary is calculated by subtracting the computed tax from the total salary.
   - The net salary is displayed in `textBox6`.
